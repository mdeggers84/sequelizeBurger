# burger - *now with sequelize!*

Project demonstrating MYSql and handlebars.js manipulation. Website allows users to add new burgers via the text field and **Add Burger** button and *order* them via **Order Burger**. I've also added a **Clear the Table** button that removes all rows from the database and resets the increment count.

### Prerequisities

I'm using the npm packages *body-parser*, *express*, *express-handlebars*, *mysql*, *sequelize*, and *method-override*.

All prereqs are listed in *package.json*. Simply clone to your machine and run `npm install` in the root folder of the app.
